The PRiME Framework doesn't use the same license for all of the code.
There is code under:

   * GPLv3+ (GNU General Public License version 3, or any later version)

   * LGPLv3+ (GNU Lesser General Public License v3 or any later version)

   * BSD with advertising

   * Public Domain

Please, check the source code for more details. A license is usually at the start
of each source file.

The ./COPYING file (GPLv3+) is the default license for code without an explicitly
defined license.
